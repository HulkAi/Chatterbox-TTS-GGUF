# Conda environments (if created inside project, though typically not)
# If your 'chatterbox-env' or 'chatterbox-test-distro' were somehow created
# inside 'resemble-ai/', you'd list them here. But they are usually global.

# Large Model Files (Users download these separately)
# IMPORTANT: If gguf-connector downloads into ./models/ AND you don't want
# to commit potentially large model files accidentally.
# If ./models/ is ONLY a placeholder for users, it can be empty and committed.
# If models are automatically downloaded INTO ./models/, then add this:
models/*.gguf
models/*.bin 
# Or more generally if the models folder can contain other large files:
# models/*
# !models/.gitkeep # (If you want to keep the 'models' folder structure but not its content)
